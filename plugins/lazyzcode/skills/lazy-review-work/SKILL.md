# review-work

> **Maps to ZCode:** parallel Agent tool dispatch (five independent subagents, ALL-MUST-PASS).

> **earlier host implementation source:** `local project documentation`

## Purpose

Launch 5 specialized ZCode Agent subagents in parallel to review completed implementation work from every angle. All 5 must pass for the review to pass. If even ONE fails or remains INCONCLUSIVE, the review does not pass. This is the final gate before claiming work is done, creating a PR, or merging.

The 5 agents cover complementary concerns that together form a comprehensive review no single reviewer could match:

| # | Agent | Type | Focus |
|---|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Goal Verifier | Oracle (read-only context) | Did we build what was asked? |
| 2 | QA Executor | Autonomous executor | Does it actually work when run? |
| 3 | Code Reviewer | Oracle (read-only context) | Is the code well-written? |
| 4 | Security Auditor | Oracle (read-only context) | Is it secure? |
| 5 | Context Miner | Autonomous executor | Did we miss any context? |

## Trigger Conditions

- User says "review work", "review my work", "review changes", "QA this"
- User says "verify implementation", "check my work", "validate changes"
- The work is a significant implementation, PR, or branch needing review
- The orchestrator's gate requires post-implementation review

## Required Context

- **GOAL**: The original objective from the user's request and any clarifications
- **CONSTRAINTS**: Rules, requirements, limitations (tech stack, performance, API contracts)
- **BACKGROUND**: Why this work was needed; business context, related systems
- **CHANGED_FILES**: Auto-collected via `git diff --name-only` against base
- **DIFF**: Auto-collected via `git diff` against base
- **CONTEXT_REFS**: Paths to the diff, changed-file manifest, plan criteria, and
  prior lane artifacts. Do not paste full file contents or the full plan.
- **RUN_COMMAND**: How to start the app (from package.json, Makefile, or user)

Use a dedicated review worktree for PR/branch reviews: `git worktree add <path> <branch>`. The main worktree is read-only context; never checkout or edit the review branch there.

## Tool Access

- Full read access: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (git, test runners, linters)
- The orchestrator spawns subagents via the ZCode Agent tool
- Oracle subagents receive full context in their prompt (they cannot use filesystem tools)
- Autonomous subagents can read files, run commands, and use tools independently

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 0: Gather Review Context

1. Extract GOAL, CONSTRAINTS, BACKGROUND from conversation history (ask only if truly missing)
2. Collect CHANGED_FILES: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` (or against appropriate base)
3. Collect DIFF: `git diff HEAD~1` (or against appropriate base)
4. Write/read artifact references for the diff and changed files; keep dispatch
   to the fixed contract plus this review lane's delta
5. Detect RUN_COMMAND from project manifests
6. Load prior lane reports and mark a lane affected only when it previously
   failed, is missing, is stale for the current revision, or its declared inputs
   changed. Preserve every other current PASS result.

### Phase 1: Launch All 5 Agents in Parallel

On the first review, launch ALL 5 in a single turn via the ZCode Agent tool,
each with `run_in_background=true`. On a review rerun, rerun only failed,
missing, stale, or input-affected lanes in one turn. Record retained PASS lanes
beside rerun lanes; never rerun an unaffected current PASS lane.

Every lane receives the fixed `TASK/DELTA/REFS/VERIFY` contract: its review-specific delta, and artifact
references. Every lane returns a terminal report with `status`, current
`run_id`, `task_id`, full `repo_head`, exact `criterion_ids`, verdict, and
artifact references. Do not paste the full plan, diff, file contents, or prior
lane prose into either packet.

**Agent 1 — Goal & Constraint Verification (Oracle, read-only prompt context)**
Verify the implementation against the original goal and constraints. Check: goal completeness (every sub-requirement), constraint compliance, requirement gaps, over-engineering, edge cases (5+ traced), behavioral correctness (3+ scenarios). Output: verdict (PASS/FAIL), confidence (HIGH/MED/LOW), goal breakdown, constraint compliance, findings, blocking issues.

**Agent 2 — QA via App Execution (Autonomous executor)**
Run the application and verify through hands-on testing. Process: brainstorm 15-30 test scenarios (happy paths, boundary conditions, error paths, regression, state transitions), self-review and augment (add 5+ more), create task list (P0/P1/P2), execute systematically. Use the appropriate channel: WebFetch for HTTP surfaces, bash for CLI, Agent tool for browser testing. If the app cannot start (build failure), immediate FAIL.

**Agent 3 — Code Quality Review (Oracle, read-only prompt context)**
Senior staff engineer code review. Examine: correctness, pattern consistency, naming & readability, error handling, type safety, performance, abstraction level, testing, API design, tech debt. Categorize findings: CRITICAL (production bugs/data loss), MAJOR (should fix before merge), MINOR (improvement, not blocking), NITPICK (style). Output: verdict, confidence, findings with file:line references, blocking issues (CRITICAL + MAJOR).

**Agent 4 — Security Review (Oracle, read-only prompt context)**
Security engineer review. Examine: input validation, auth/authz bypass, secrets in code, data exposure, dependency CVEs, cryptography, path traversal, CORS/TLS, error leakage, supply chain. Categorize: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE. Output: verdict, severity, findings with risk+remediation, blocking issues (CRITICAL + HIGH).

**Agent 5 — Context Mining (Autonomous executor)**
Search all accessible sources for missed context. Search: git history (`git log`, `git blame`, commit messages), GitHub issues/PRs if `gh` CLI available, codebase cross-references (importers, config files, docs), and any available MCP channels. Output: verdict, confidence, sources searched, discovered context with impact (BLOCKING/IMPORTANT/FYI), missed requirements, blocking issues.

### Phase 2: Wait & Collect with Bounded Polling

After launching all 5 agents, wait for completions. Use `TaskOutput` to poll for results. Do not treat a timeout, ack-only reply, or empty result as PASS.

Track each lane independently:

| Agent | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 1. Goal Verification | pending/PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | |
| 2. QA Execution | pending/PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | |
| 3. Code Quality | pending/PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | |
| 4. Security | pending/PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | |
| 5. Context Mining | pending/PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | |

Do NOT deliver the final report until ALL 5 lanes reach a terminal state (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE). If a lane is silent, send a follow-up; if still unfinished, mark INCONCLUSIVE and respawn a smaller agent for that lane (max 3 retries per lane). Do not spin in repeated wait cycles.

A lost lane response may be recovered only from a complete terminal report
bound to the current task, repository revision, and criterion set with readable
artifact references. Ack-only, partial, mismatched, or stale reports remain
missing. Recovery never substitutes the executor for an independent reviewer.

Validate each lane terminal report as a lazyseries completion record before it counts as a current PASS: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/contracts/validate-lazyseries-record.js completion <lane-record.json>`. A report that fails validation is treated as missing, not PASS.

### Phase 3: Deliver Verdict

```
ALL 5 PASS → REVIEW PASSED
ANY FAIL → REVIEW FAILED — criteria not met
ANY INCONCLUSIVE and 0 FAIL → REVIEW INCONCLUSIVE — not approved
```

Compile the report: overall verdict, per-agent verdict table with confidence, aggregated blocking issues (deduplicated, prioritized), top 5-10 key findings grouped by theme, specific fix instructions in priority order (if FAILED).

## Expected Output Artifacts

1. Per-agent verdict with confidence score and findings
2. Aggregated final report with per-agent verdict table
3. Blocking issues list (deduplicated, prioritized, with file:line refs)
4. Fix instructions in priority order (if FAILED or INCONCLUSIVE)
5. All evidence redacted: no secrets, tokens, credentials, PII

## Verification Gates

1. Initial review launches all 5 agents in parallel; reruns launch only affected lanes
2. All 5 lanes have a terminal verdict (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE)
3. Every PASS has supporting evidence from the agent's output
4. INCONCLUSIVE lanes have been retried with max budget (3)
5. Retry budget honored: respawned smaller agents for missing deliverables
6. Final report includes all lanes with evidence
7. Retained and rerun results together contain five current PASS verdicts before approval
8. Every retained and rerun lane terminal report validates via `validate-lazyseries-record.js completion` before approval

## Failure Behavior

- If a lane returns FAIL: record specific findings; rerun that lane after its
  inputs change, without rerunning unaffected PASS lanes
- If a lane is INCONCLUSIVE: retry with smaller agent (up to 3 times); if still inconclusive, record as not approved and emit the aggregate result
- If an agent times out or returns ack-only: do not count as PASS; follow up; if no deliverable after follow-up, mark INCONCLUSIVE
- If all lanes INCONCLUSIVE after full retry budget: emit REVIEW INCONCLUSIVE with per-lane status and retry count
- Redact secrets and PII before including any evidence in logs or reports

## Handoff Format

```
# Review Work — Final Report

## Overall Verdict: PASSED / FAILED / INCONCLUSIVE

| # | Review Area | Agent Type | Verdict | Confidence |
|---|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Goal & Constraint Verification | Oracle | PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| 2 | QA Execution | Autonomous | PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| 3 | Code Quality | Oracle | PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| 4 | Security | Oracle | PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | Severity |
| 5 | Context Mining | Autonomous | PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE | HIGH/MED/LOW |

## Blocking Issues
[Aggregated from all agents — deduplicated, prioritized]

## Key Findings
[Top 5-10 findings grouped by theme]

## Recommendations
[If FAILED: exactly what to fix, in priority order]
[If PASSED: non-blocking suggestions]
```

## ZCode-Native Features

- **Agent tool:** All 5 subagents are spawned via the ZCode Agent tool with `run_in_background=true`. Oracle agents receive full context in their prompt (TASK/DELIVERABLE/SCOPE/VERIFY). Autonomous agents receive goal, scope, and tool permissions. This replaces earlier host implementation's `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` with `agent_type`.
- **TaskOutput:** Polling for subagent completions uses ZCode's `TaskOutput` tool instead of earlier host implementation's `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent`. Track spawned task IDs locally and poll with bounded cycles.
- **TaskCreate/TaskUpdate:** The orchestrator tracks progress via ZCode's native task management. Each review lane is a separate task; status transitions are marked with TaskUpdate.
- **Worktree discipline:** Use `git worktree add` for isolated review workspaces. Review evidence is collected from the worktree path, not the main worktree. The `.lazyzcode/` directory replaces earlier host implementation's `.lazyzcode/` for review artifacts.
- **Browser testing:** QA Executor uses WebFetch for HTTP-visible surfaces and the ZCode Agent tool with browser instructions for visual surfaces. This replaces earlier host implementation's `browser:control-in-app-browser`.
- **Retry budget:** 3 retries per lane, tracked manually by the orchestrator. Each retry spawns a fresh, smaller `isolation: true` agent with only the missing deliverable.
