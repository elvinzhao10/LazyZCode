# verifier

> **Maps to ZCode:** an isolated Agent tool subagent for independent verification.

> **earlier host implementation source:** `local project documentation` Phase 4 (Sisyphus completion contract: AdversarialVerify).

## Purpose

Independently verify a worker's DoneClaim. Run the exact verification commands the worker claims to have run, reproduce the Manual-QA scenario, probe every applicable adversarial class, and issue a verdict with a confidence score. The verifier is NEVER the same agent as the executor.

## Trigger Conditions

- A worker returns a DoneClaim that needs verification
- User says "verify this", "check the evidence", "did it really pass?"
- Orchestrator's `start-work` Phase 4 gate

## Required Context

- The DoneClaim to verify (task, changed_files, tests, manual_qa, cleanup, risks)
- The plan reference and acceptance criteria
- The `.lazyzcode/runs/<run_id>/events.jsonl` for historical evidence

## Check Discovery (v0.9)

The verifier discovers available checks dynamically from the project's toolchain, not from a hardcoded list. For each of the 8 check categories, the verifier probes the project for executability before including the check in the verification plan. A check that cannot be discovered (missing config file, no runner binary) is recorded as `not_applicable` rather than `skipped`.

| # | Category | Discovery method | Required signal |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **syntax** | Glob for parser/converter configs (e.g., `biome.json`, `.eslintrc*`, `pyproject.toml`) and probe the parser with `--check` equivalent | Config file present AND parser binary reachable |
| 2 | **typecheck** | Glob for `tsconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`, `pyrightconfig.json`, or equivalent; probe `tsc --noEmit` or equivalent | Config present AND typechecker executable in PATH or node_modules |
| 3 | **lint** | Glob for lint configs (`.eslintrc*`, `biome.json`, `.rubocop.yml`); probe `lint` or `check` subcommand | Linter binary reachable from project root |
| 4 | **unit** | Glob for test runner configs (`vitest.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg`); probe `test` or `test:unit` script from `package.json` or `Makefile` | Test script defined AND runner reachable |
| 5 | **integration** | Same as unit but probe `test:integration` or `test:e2e` script; skip if no separate integration suite is defined | Separate integration test script exists |
| 6 | **plugin-validation** | Look for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lazyzcode-verify.sh`; if present, run it as the aggregate plugin health check | Script file exists and is executable |
| 7 | **docs-consistency** | Look for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lazyzcode-docs-check.sh`; if present, run it | Script exists and is executable |
| 9 | **security** | Look for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lazyzcode-security-check.sh`; if present, run it | Script exists and is executable |

The verifier records its discovery log in the verification output, with one line per category: `"<category>": "discovered" | "not_applicable (<reason>)"`.

## Check Execution

Each discovered check is run with exactly one Bash invocation. The verifier captures stdout, stderr, and the exit code for every check. Outcomes are classified into exactly one of:

| Outcome | Meaning | Treatment |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `hard_failure` | Exit code ≠ 0 AND output indicates a real defect (not a config/env issue) | Blocks `confirmed` verdict; task goes to `needs-fix` |
| `soft_warning` | Exit code ≠ 0 but the failure is likely config/env-related or pre-existing | Recorded in evidence; does not block `confirmed` unless cumulative warnings exceed threshold |
| `skipped` | Check was discovered but deliberately not run (e.g., integration suite takes too long, flagged as `manual-only`) | Recorded with reason; verifier notes that coverage is incomplete |
| `not_applicable` | Check could not be discovered (no config, no runner) | Recorded; no gap in coverage |

All check results are written to `.lazyzcode/runs/<run_id>/verification/checks.jsonl` — one JSON line per check with `{category, outcome, exit_code, stdout_sha256, stderr_sha256, duration_ms}`. A summary file `summary.json` is also written with `{total, hard_failure, soft_warning, skipped, not_applicable, all_pass: boolean}`.

## Check Scripts (v0.9)

The verifier relies on five health-check scripts under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`. Each script is a self-contained, zero-dependency (beyond `bash` and core POSIX tools) checker that returns exit code 0 on pass and outputs a JSON summary line.

| Script | Purpose | Exit 0 means |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `lazyzcode-verify.sh` | Master runner — executes all checks in sequence | All sub-checks pass (`all_pass: true`) |
| `lazyzcode-security-check.sh` | Secret/credential leak scanner | No secrets found in plugin files |
| `lazyzcode-docs-check.sh` | Broken internal markdown link checker | All internal Markdown links resolve |
| `lazyzcode-plugin-doctor.sh` | Plugin structural health check (preexisting) | Plugin is structurally sound |
| `lazyzcode-smoke-test.sh` | Plugin basic functionality smoke test (preexisting) | Core plugin behaviors work |

The verifier calls `lazyzcode-verify.sh` as the single entry point for all plugin-level health checks. If individual checks are needed (e.g., for incremental verification of a single task), the verifier may call the specialized scripts directly.

## Tool Access

This skill is **read-only** — it NEVER writes product code.
- Allowed: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (read-only verification commands)
- Disallowed: Write, Edit

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Discover available checks

- Read the DoneClaim's `tests` and `manual_qa` fields
- Identify what automated checks to run (typecheck, lint, test suite, build)
- Identify the Manual-QA channel (HTTP, browser, tmux, CLI)

### 2. Run the checks

- Execute every automated verification command the worker claims to have run
- Reproduce the Manual-QA scenario using the exact tool + invocation from the claim
- Capture exact output, not summaries

### 3. Probe adversarial classes

For HEAVY-tier work, probe every applicable adversarial class from the 9 ultraqa classes:
- malformed_input, prompt_injection, stale_state, dirty_worktree, cancel_resume
- hung_commands, flaky_tests, misleading_success_output, repeated_interruptions

For non-applicable classes: record with a one-line "not applicable because..." reason.

### 4. Issue verdict

| Verdict | Meaning | Condition |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `confirmed` | Evidence is valid | All checks pass; Manual-QA reproduced; confidence ≥ 0.8 |
| `false-positive` | Evidence is fabricated | Claimed test fails when re-run; Manual-QA does not produce claimed output |
| `needs-fix` | Evidence is incomplete | Some checks pass but not all; a gap exists |
| `needs-human-review` | Cannot determine | Confidence < 0.8; edge case requiring human judgment |

## Expected Output Artifacts

```json
{
  "AdversarialVerify": {
    "task": "<task id>",
    "verdict": "confirmed|false-positive|needs-fix|needs-human-review",
    "evidence": ["command + result", "artifact path"],
    "repro": "exact command or manual steps",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "adversarial_classes": {
      "malformed_input": { "probed": true, "result": "PASS" },
      "stale_state": { "probed": false, "reason": "no cached artifacts in scope" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification Gates

1. All claimed tests run and produce identical results
2. Manual-QA reproduced successfully
3. All applicable adversarial classes probed
4. Verdict is clear with confidence score
5. Evidence is self-contained (another agent can re-verify from the evidence alone)

## Failure Behavior

- If automated tests fail: record exact failure; do NOT mark as confirmed
- If Manual-QA cannot be reproduced: request exact repro steps from executor
- If confidence < 0.8: mark `needs-human-review`; do NOT guess
- If verifier cannot be independent (root also implemented): escalate to gate-reviewer subagent

## Handoff Format

```
Verifier verdict: {confirmed | false-positive | needs-fix | needs-human-review}
  Confidence: {0.0-1.0}
  Evidence: {command + results}
  Adversarial: {class-by-class results}
```

## State Ledger Integration (v0.7)

The verifier now writes verification results through the state/ script layer for durable, auditable evidence.

- **Verification results:** After completing all checks (automated tests, Manual-QA reproduction, adversarial probe), the verifier calls `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state/append-event.sh <run_id> adversarial_verify "<json>"` to write the full AdversarialVerify verdict — including `verdict`, `confidence`, `evidence[]`, `repro`, and `adversarial_classes{}` — as a structured event in `events.jsonl`. Each event is a single JSON object on one line in JSONL format.
- **State synchronization:** After writing the event, the verifier reads `state.json` and updates the task's `verification_gates` field by calling `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state/update-task.sh <run_id> <task_index> verify --field verdict=<verdict> --field confidence=<score>`. This keeps `state.json`'s task entries in sync with the detailed evidence in `events.jsonl`.
- **Independence guarantee:** The verifier runs as an isolated Agent (`isolation: true`) with no shared context, ensuring the adversarial check is truly independent from the executor's claims.

## ZCode-Native Features

- **Subagent isolation:** Verifier runs as isolated subagent with no parent history (`isolation: true`)
- **Agent tool:** Verifier is spawned by orchestrator via ZCode Agent tool
- **Evidence ledger:** Results appended to `.lazyzcode/runs/<run_id>/events.jsonl`
