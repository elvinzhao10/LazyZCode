# coding-agent-sessions

Find and inspect coding-agent sessions across ZCode and other platforms before answering from memory. Use LazyZCode's session tracking state as the primary store; fall back to platform-native transcript files when available.

## Global ZCode Work fallback

This installed skill is self-contained. It does not require a helper script or reference bundle. Use the local paths listed below when they are available; for an unlisted platform, ask the user for its documented transcript location before searching.

## Purpose

Reconstruct past sessions so agents can answer "what did we already do" questions without relying on memory. The LazyZCode sessions store (`.lazyzcode/state/sessions.json`) is the primary source; platform transcript files supplement when the user asks about non-ZCode sessions.

## Required Context to Inspect

- `.lazyzcode/state/sessions.json` — LazyZCode session tracking (primary store).
- `.lazyzcode/state/boulder.json` — active work-in-progress state.
- `.lazyzcode/state/active-loop.json` — active ulw-loop plan with goal statuses.
- `.lazyzcode/evidence/` — recorded evidence from past verification runs.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. List Recent Sessions (ZCode)

Read `.lazyzcode/state/sessions.json` to inspect tracked ZCode sessions:

```
Read .lazyzcode/state/sessions.json
```

The `sessions` object contains session IDs mapped to metadata: `session_id`, `started_at`, `last_active_at`, `status`, `active_plan`, `work_id`, `agent`, `mode`. The `compaction_state` field tracks compaction history.

### 2. Search by Keyword or Date

Use Grep to search session metadata and evidence files for keywords:

```
Grep "keyword" .lazyzcode/state/sessions.json
Grep "keyword" .lazyzcode/evidence/
```

For date-based search, inspect the `started_at` and `last_active_at` ISO timestamps in sessions.json entries.

### 3. Read Session Details

To reconstruct what happened in a session:
- Read the session's `active_plan` (e.g., `.lazyzcode/plans/<plan-name>.md`) for the plan that was being executed.
- Read `.lazyzcode/state/boulder.json` for task-by-task progress.
- Read `.lazyzcode/state/active-loop.json` for goal and criterion statuses.
- Read `.lazyzcode/evidence/` files named after the work for verification results.

### 4. Cross-Platform Search (Non-ZCode Sessions)

When the user asks about sessions from other coding agents:
- Use Grep/Glob only in the user's approved local path.
- For ZCode native transcripts: `~/.zcode-cn/cache/projects/`.
- For Codex: `.codex/state_*.sqlite`, rollout JSONL files.
- For Claude: `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.claude/transcripts/`.
- For OpenCode: `~/.opencode/`, `~/.local/share/opencode/`.
- For another platform: ask the user for the official local storage path, or consult that platform's official documentation before searching.

### 5. Reconstruct Past Work

Combine session metadata with evidence to reconstruct what was done:
1. Find the session by keyword or date.
2. Read the session's active plan to understand the objective.
3. Read boulder state for per-task completion status.
4. Read evidence files for verification results (test runs, Manual-QA, reviewer findings).
5. Summarize: what was accomplished, what was blocked, what remains.

## Allowed Edits

- Read `.lazyzcode/state/sessions.json`, `.lazyzcode/state/boulder.json`, `.lazyzcode/state/active-loop.json`.
- Search `.lazyzcode/evidence/` for past verification artifacts.
- Read platform transcript files at documented paths (read-only).

## Forbidden Behavior

- Do NOT answer from memory. Always check the session store first.
- Do NOT modify session state files during read operations.
- Do NOT fabricate session details when the store is empty — report the gap.
- Do NOT read or expose secrets, tokens, or API keys from session files.
- Do NOT search outside documented paths without user consent.

## Verification Gates

1. **Plan reread**: All requested session queries have been addressed.
2. **Automated verification**: Session store files are valid JSON and parse correctly.
3. **Manual-QA**: Reconstructed timeline matches user's recollection.
4. **Adversarial QA**: Empty session store handled gracefully. Missing platform transcripts reported clearly.
5. **Cleanup**: No temporary files left from cross-platform transcript reads.

## Failure Handling

- If `.lazyzcode/state/sessions.json` is empty or absent: report that no ZCode sessions have been tracked yet.
- If a platform transcript path is not found: report the missing path and suggest manual location.
- If session metadata is incomplete: report what is available and note what is missing.
- If the user asks about an unlisted platform: report the unknown storage path and ask for the platform's documented location.

## Output Format

```
=== Session Search Results ===

Platform: ZCode
Store: .lazyzcode/state/sessions.json
Sessions Found: {N}

Session: {session_id}
  Started: {started_at}
  Last Active: {last_active_at}
  Status: {status}
  Active Plan: {active_plan}
  Work ID: {work_id}
  Agent: {agent}
  Mode: {mode}

=== Reconstructed Work ===

Plan: {plan summary}
Tasks Completed: {N}/{total}
Evidence: {references to evidence files}
```

## Handoff Target

After session reconstruction, hand findings to the requesting agent. If the user wants to continue prior work, hand off to `ulw-plan` for a new plan or `start-work` to resume execution.
