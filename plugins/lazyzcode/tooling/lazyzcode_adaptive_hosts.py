"""Adaptive host mapping for v1.0.3 (LazyZCode side).

Maps an adaptive decision to first-class ZCode full-plugin host resources
per plan Section 10 and Section 18. Keeps Skills/MCP-only fallback routing
separate and explicitly degraded.

ZCode ships a single host whose plugin manifest (.zcode-plugin/plugin.json)
DOES declare a "skills" field, so workflow surfaces map to skills, commands,
and agents alike. Internal names are NOT required to match any other host.
