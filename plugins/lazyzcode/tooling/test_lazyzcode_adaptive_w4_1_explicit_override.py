"""W4.1 Explicit Override integration tests for the v1.0.3 Adaptive Harness.

Proves that explicit user workflow requests remain authoritative and are not
silently downgraded or replaced by the adaptive classifier. Mirrors the
LazyTrae adaptive-w4-1-explicit-override.test.js for behavioral parity per
plan Section 6 (resolution order step 1) and the 07-explicit-workflow-override
fixture.

Scenarios covered (equivalent coverage in both repos):
  1. Fixture regression -- 07-explicit-workflow-override.json
  2. "create a plan only" -> planned mode, no implement stage
  3. "do this directly; do not create a plan" -> direct mode, no plan stage
  4. "run an independent review" -> orchestrated mode with review responsibility
  5. "use lazy-ulw-loop for this" -> long-horizon mode
  6. Negative -- explicit lazy-ulw-plan must NOT be downgraded to direct
  7. Negative -- explicit lazy-review-work must NOT be silently replaced
  8. Authority -- explicit selection preserved when boundaries are present
