"""Adaptive mapping for v1.0.3 (LazyZCode side).

Maps an adaptive decision (output of ``classify_adaptive_decision`` in
``lazyzcode_adaptive_detector``) to existing LazyZCode workflow surfaces
per plan Section 10 (Runtime-specific mapping).

This is a thin adapter: it selects existing surfaces (Skills, commands,
agents, hooks, MCP services, run/state). It does not duplicate execution
logic and does not introduce a second orchestration runtime.
