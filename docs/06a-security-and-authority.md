# Security and authority

LazyZCode's local checks are useful evidence, but they are never authority to
change a host, access a credential, or claim that a host integration is live.
The selected ZCode session remains the authority for that host's plugin
loading, hooks, and MCP connection. Automated package verification is defined
by the product CI workflows (Ubuntu and macOS jobs). Supplied host
observations are historical macOS reports; they do not establish a current
v1.3.4 host session.

## What the package policy protects

The PreToolUse policy denies secret-like targets for structured `Write` and
`Edit` requests. It examines only the string fields `path`, `file_path`, and
`filePath`; it normalizes separators and lexical traversal for matching. Text
in content, replacement text, descriptions, nested fields, or unrelated keys
does not become a target path merely because it mentions `.env` or `id_rsa`.

`Bash` deliberately retains a conservative literal scan of its command input.
That protects obvious secret-path access, but can produce false positives when
a command merely contains a secret-like path literal. LazyZCode does not claim
to parse shell syntax semantically. Destructive deletion, force-push/hard
reset, and unapproved publication checks remain separate denials.

## Network and documentation boundary

The bundled `docs` MCP resolves package documentation only through fixed HTTPS
registry requests: `registry.npmjs.org` for npm and `pypi.org` for PyPI. It
accepts validated package names, disables redirects, and never fetches a
homepage, repository, documentation URL, or arbitrary metadata link. Registry
metadata can be returned as text; it is not permission to follow a URL inside
that metadata. See [the MCP inventory](reference/mcp-inventory.md).

## Explicit roots, not discovery

From an unrelated workspace, an operator can name the copied plugin directly:

```bash
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/plugins/lazyzcode" \
  bash /absolute/path/to/plugins/lazyzcode/scripts/lazyzcode-load-check.sh
```

The explicit override selects that plugin root directly; it does not discover a
different plugin root through parents, siblings, marketplaces, or a filesystem
scan. The load check can still read a parent `marketplace.json`
when no explicit `LAZYZCODE_MARKETPLACE_FILE` is supplied, solely to validate a
marketplace entry's version against the selected root's manifest. That metadata
validation is not plugin-root discovery and does not install, register, or
prove a host integration. Without `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, only the documented
copied-repository/plugin-root layouts are tried, and an unavailable-root result
is expected elsewhere. This is package-readiness evidence, not host proof.

## Decisions that stay with the user

Host settings, marketplace installation, credentials, remote providers,
browser automation, and any connector registration require the host flow or an
explicit approval. The capability broker is task-scoped; it does not rewrite
host configuration or persist a registration. Continue with [receipts and
owned tooling](06b-receipts-and-owned-tooling.md) and [host routes](reference/host-routes.md).

## Enforcement points and deliberate limits

| Boundary | Enforced by | What it deliberately does not claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structured secret target | `pre-tool-use.sh` path component matching | A full shell parser or content-scanning authorization system. |
| Shell command text | Conservative `Bash` literal scan | Semantic understanding of every shell expansion or subcommand. |
| Documentation network access | `mcp/docs/server.py` fixed npm/PyPI registries, HTTPS, redirects disabled | Permission to follow package metadata URLs. |
| Plugin root | Explicit `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` or documented package layout | Discovery of any plausible sibling/parent plugin. |
| Capability consent | Policy/approval records keyed by contract digest | A permanent grant across contract or workspace changes. |

Security is therefore fail-closed at the boundaries the package can model, not a claim that the package can sandbox a host or make arbitrary external code safe. The regression suite attacks each of these narrow boundaries directly.
