# Technical architecture guide

The current package version is [v1.3.5](../RELEASE_NOTES.md). Package
verification and fresh native-host acceptance are separate; host acceptance
remains pending.

This tree explains how LazyZCode is built. It is a source-reading guide, not
an installation manual: each page names the executable boundary, the data it
owns, and the evidence that constrains its behavior. Use the root
[README](../README.md) for host directions.

## System at a glance

    Host["ZCode host"] --> Surface["skills, commands, agents"]

```

The host loads integrations; `plugins/lazyzcode/` supplies their definitions.
Scripts and MCP endpoints operate only on their defined package/project
boundaries. Host state is deliberately outside those boundaries. On ZCode,
the harness primitives map to native surfaces: project memory in `AGENTS.md`
(init-deep), planning via the `lazy-ulw-plan` skill/command, execution via
`lazy-start-work` with Agent-tool subagents, review via parallel Agent
dispatch (5 lanes), per-agent `model`/`thoughtLevel` routing, the 7 hook
events, and the 6 auto-connected local MCP servers. The
[ZCode integration reference](reference/zcode-integration.md) is the
concise map.

## Read the implementation in this order

1. [00 — Architecture tour](00-learning-path.md) identifies the package
   boundary and the request-to-evidence path.
2. [01 — Execution model](01-mental-model.md) explains workflow text, agents,
   hooks, scripts, and proof as separate layers.
3. [07 — Package map](07-package-map.md) maps those layers to files; follow it
   with [07a — State and validation](07a-state-and-validation.md) and
   [07b — MCP lifecycle](07b-mcp-lifecycle.md).
4. [06a — Security and authority](06a-security-and-authority.md) and
   [06b — Receipts and owned tooling](06b-receipts-and-owned-tooling.md)
   explain why the package refuses broad discovery and deletion.
5. [09 — Test and release verification](09-test-and-release-verification.md)
   connects unit, package, protocol, and host evidence.

## Technical map

| Page | Implementation question answered |
| --- | --- |
| [00 — Architecture tour](00-learning-path.md) | Which component receives an event, and where does its result go? |
| [01 — Execution model](01-mental-model.md) | Why are instructions, execution, state, and proof distinct layers? |
| [02 — Request decomposition](02-first-task.md) | How does an outcome become acceptance criteria and a proof surface? |
| [03 — Package delivery](03-install-and-host-verification.md) | What does the ZCode plugin marketplace route establish, and what does it not establish? |
| [04 — Workflow playbooks](04-workflow-playbooks.md) | How do skills, commands, and agent roles encode proportional workflow policy? |
| [05 — Evidence and completion](05-evidence-and-completion.md) | How are checks, statuses, timeouts, and completion claims kept honest? |
| [06 — Capabilities and approvals](06-capabilities-and-approvals.md) | How does local-first capability selection avoid persistent mutation? |
| [06a — Security and authority](06a-security-and-authority.md) | Which inputs, paths, registries, and user decisions are trusted? |
| [06b — Receipts and owned tooling](06b-receipts-and-owned-tooling.md) | How does tooling record and later prove limited ownership? |
| [07 — Package map](07-package-map.md) | Which source directories implement each runtime surface? |
| [07a — State and validation](07a-state-and-validation.md) | Which artifacts are durable, validated, and safe to mutate? |
| [07b — MCP lifecycle](07b-mcp-lifecycle.md) | How does a declaration become a JSON-RPC process without becoming host proof? |
| [08 — Safe removal](08-safe-removal.md) | Why does removal stop at package-owned paths? |
| [09 — Test and release verification](09-test-and-release-verification.md) | What does each release gate prove? |
| [10 — Host capability matrix](10-host-capability-matrix.md) | Where does ZCode diverge from other hosts in the series? |
